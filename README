Disk Filer is a disk file name database program for the Commodore 64.  It supports auto-directory reading and manual entries, sorting, disk ID fields, printing, and includes a disk/drive control prompt.

Building:
Disk Filer can be run in native BASIC.  The machine language portion (ssort.ml) should be assembled and then renamed to "ssort.ml" before using, as the BASIC portion requires it.
